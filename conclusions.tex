\section{Final Note}
Similar techniques to those presented can show that if the vertices of graph $G$ are ordered by the sum of $R_ec_e$ on edges that have an endpoint of that vertex, any graph has a sparsifier that can be written as the union of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trees with that topological ordering on their vertices. The proof uses the same machinery as that presented above (with a slightly different use of the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava sampling scheme), and we omit the full proof here.
