  \maketitle \footnotetext{An earlier version of this result (including a proof that the
Spielman Srivastava sparsifier is uniformly sparse, and that each
graph had a constant number of trees) was worked out with Michael B.
Cohen from MIT, Jakub Pachocki from OpenAI, and Richard Peng from
Georgia Tech in 2014, under the direction of Gary Miller from Carnegie Mellon
University. Those results can be found on arxiv, and will be
uploaded shortly.}
