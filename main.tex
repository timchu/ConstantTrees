  \maketitle \footnotetext{An earlier version of this result (including a proof that the
Spielman Srivastava sparsifier is uniformly sparse, and that each
graph has a spectral sparsifier that is a constant number of trees) was
    worked out with the author, Michael B.
Cohen from MIT, Jakub Pachocki from OpenAI, and Richard Peng from
Georgia Tech in 2014, under the direction of Gary Miller from Carnegie Mellon
University. Those results can be found on arxiv, and are in the proces
of arxiv submission. A link to these will be added as soon as it is
available.
