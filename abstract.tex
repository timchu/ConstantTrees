\begin{abstract}
We show that every graph has a $(1+\eps)$ spectral sparsifier with a
$O(1/\eps^2)$ arboricity. Moreover, we show that a range of $(1+\eps)$
sparsifiers that
are based on leverage score sampling, have nearly constant arboricity
for constant $\epsilon$.
This includes the sparsifiers of Spielman and Srivastava, the semi-streaming
sparsifiers of Kelner-Levin and Kyng-Pachocki-Peng-Sachdeva, and more.
